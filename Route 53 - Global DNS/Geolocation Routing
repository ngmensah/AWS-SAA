Geolocation Routing

  allows you to choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users (the location DNS queries originate from).
  Geolocation records are tagged with location. Either US state, country, continent, or default
  When a user is making a resolution request, an IP check verifies the location of the user (normally the resolver)
  *Geolocation doesn't return the "closest" records, only the relevant (location) records*
  R53 checks for records:
    1) in the state
    2) the country
    3) the continent
    4) (optionally) default
  it returns the most specific record or NO ANSWER
  Can be used for regional restrictions, language specific content or load balancing across regional endpoints
