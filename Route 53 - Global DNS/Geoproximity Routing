Geoproximity Routing

  lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of your users and your resources.
  You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a bias. 
  A bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource.
  Records can be tagged with an AWS region or lat & lon coordinates
  "+" or "-" bias can be added to rules. "+" increases a region size and decreases neighbouring regions
  Routing is distance based (including bias)
