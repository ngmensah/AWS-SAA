R53 CNAME vs ALIAS

CNAME (the problem)
  and "A" records maps a NAME to an IP ADDRESS (Ex: catagram.io -> 1.3.3.7
  CNAME maps a NAME to another NAME (Ex: www.catagram.io -> catagram.io)
  CNAME is invalid for naked/apex (catagram.io)
  Many AWS services use a DNS name (Elastic Load Balancer (ELBs))
  With just CNAME - catagram.io -> ELB would be invalid
  
ALIAS (The solution)
  ALIAS records map a NAME to an AWS rewsource
  Can be used both for naked/apex and normal records
  for non apex/naked - functions like CNAME
  There is no charge for ALIAS requests pointing at AWS resources
  For AWS Services - default to picking ALIAS
  Should be the same "Type" as what the record is pointing at
  ALIAS records are used when pointing at AWS services such as API Gateway, CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, Elastic Load Balancers, Global Accelerator, and S3 buckets
  Can only use if R53 is hosting your domains
