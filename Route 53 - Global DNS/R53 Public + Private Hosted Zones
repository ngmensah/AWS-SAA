R53 Public Hosted Zones
  a container that holds infomation about how you want to route traffic on the internet for a specific domain which is accessible from the public internet.
  a DNS DB for a domain. (Ex. animals4life.org)
  globally resilient (multiple DNS servers)
  created with domain registration via R53 - can be created separately
  Host DNS Records (Ex. A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT)
  Hosted Zones are what the DNS system references - Authoritiative for a domain (EX. Aminals4life.org)
  DNS Database (Zone file) hosted by R53 (Public Name Server) 
  Accessible from the public internet and within VPSs using the R53 resolver
  Hosted pn "4" R53 Name servers (NS) specific for the zone
  use "NS records" to point at these NS (connect to glocal DNS)
  Resource records (RR) are created within Hosted Zone
  Externally registered domains can point at R53 public zone
  VPC +2 address = R53 Resolver
  Walking The Tree = how any public internet host can access the records inside a public hosted zone using DNS
  
R53 Private Hosted Zone
    A public Hosted Zone that isn't public
    associated with VPCs in AWS
    Only accessible within VPCs that it is associated with
    using different accounts is supported via CLI/API
    Split-view (overlapping public & private) for PUBLIC and INTERNAL use with the same zone name
    inaccessible from the public internet. Private zone cannot be queried outside of associated VPCs
    In order to access a private hosted zone, the service needs to be running inside a VPC and the VPC needs to be associated with the private hosted zone
    Inside VPCs associated with the private hosted zone all resource records can be accessed.
    A common architechture is to make the private zone a superset, containing more sensitive records
