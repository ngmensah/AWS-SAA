Multi-Master writes

    - Default Aurora mode is single-Master
    - 1 Read/write and 0+ read only replicas
    - cluster endpoint is used to write, read endpoint is used for load balanced reads
    - failover takes time - replica promoted to read/write
    - in multi-master mode all instances are read/write
