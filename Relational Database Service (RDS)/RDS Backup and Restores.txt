RDS Backup & Restore

RPO vs RTO

RPO (Recovery Point Objective)

    - Time between the last backup and the time of an incident
    - Represents the maximum amount of data loss
    - Influences technical solutions & cost
    - Generally lower values cost more
    
RTO (Rocovery Time Objective)

    - Time between the failure and when the system has fully recovered
    - Influenced by process, staff, tech and documentation
    - Generally lower values cost more
    
RDS Backups

    - There are 2 types of backups in RDS:
        - Automated Backups
        - Manual Snapshots
    
    - Both use AWS Managed S3 buckets
    
    - Any data contained in backups is region resilient because in S3, data is replicated across multiple AWS AZ's in a region
    
    - RDS Backups occur form either:
        - Single database instance (If Multi-AZ is disabled)
        - Standby instance (If Multi-AZ is enabled)
    
    - First snapshot is FULL size of consumed data. Then Incremental afterwards
    - Manual snapshots don't expire
    - Transaction logs are written to S3 every 5 minutes
    - RDS Retention period = 0 to 35 days
    - RDS creates a NEW RDS Instance - new address
    - Snapshots = single point in time, creation time
    - Automated = any 5 minute point in time
    - Backup is restored and transaction logs are 'replayed' to bring DB to desired point in time
    - Restores aren't fast - Think about RTO
