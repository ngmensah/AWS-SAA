Aurora Architecture Key differences

    - Uses a cluster
    - a single primary instance + 0 or more replicas
    - different from RDS
    - no local storage - uses cluster volume
    - faster provisioning & improved availability & performance
    
Aurora Storage Architecture

    - All SSD based - high IOPS, low latency
    - Storage is billed based on what's used
    - High water mark - billed for the most used
    - storage which is freed up can be re-used
    - Replicas can be added and removed without requiring storage provisioning
    - Cluster endpoint always points at the primary instance. Endpoint used for read/write endpoints
    - Reader endpoint will point to the primary endpoint and will load balance across available replicas
    
Cost
 
    - no free tier option
    - Auroa doesn't support Micro instances
    - Beyond RDS singleAZ (micro)) Aurora offewrs better value
    - Compute - hourly charge, per secong, 10 min minimum
    - Storage - GB-Month consumed, IO cost per request
    - 100% DB size in backups are included
    
Aurora Restore , Clone & Backtrack
 
    - Backups in Aurora work in the same way as RDS
    - Restores create a new cluster
    - Backtrack can be used which allow in-place rewinds to a previous point in time
    - Fast clones make a new DB MUCH faster than copying all the data - copy-on-write
