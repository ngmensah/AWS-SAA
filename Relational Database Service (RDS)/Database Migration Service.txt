Database Migration Service (DMS)

		- A managed database migration service
		- Runs using a replication instance
		- Source and Destination Endpoints point at Source and target databases
		- One endpoint must be on AWS
		
		- Common DB Support
				- MySQL
				- Aurora
				- Microsoft SQL
				- MariaDB
				- MongoDB
				- PostgreSQL
				- Oracle
				- Azure SQL
				
		- Replication instance within DMS can define replication tasks
		- Replication instance performs the migration between SOurce and Destination endpoints which store connection information for source and target databases
		
		- There are 3 types of jobs in DMS:
				- Full Load Migration (one off migration of all data)
				- Full Load + Change Data capture (CDC) - for ongoing replication which captures changes
				- Change Data capture (CDC) only - used if you want to use an alternative method to transfer the bulk DB data such as native tooling
				
Schema Conversion tool (SCT)

		- Can assist with Schema Conversion
		- Used when converting one database engine to another
		- It can be used as part of migrations where the engines being migrated from and to aren't compatible
		- It can be used for larger migrations
		- Including DB -> S3 (Migrations using DMS)
		- SCT is not used when migrating between DB's of the same type/engine
				- Example: On-prem MySQL -> RDS MySQL
		- SCT works with OLTP DB types (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle)
		- SCT works with OLAP DB types (Teradata, Oracle, Vertica, Greenplum etc)
		
		- Examples of where SCT would be used:
				- On-Prem MSSQL -> RDS MySQL
				- On-Prem Oracle -> Aurora
				
DMS & Snowball

		- Larger migrations might be multi-TB in size
		- moving data over networks takes time and consumes capacity
		- DMS can utilize snowball
			- Step 1: Use SCT to extract data locally and moce to a snowball device
			- Step 2: Ship the device back to AWS. They load onto an S3 bucket
			- Step 3: DMS migrates from S3 into the target store
			- Step 4: Change Data Capture (CDC) can capture changes, and via S3 intermediary they are also written to the target database.
			
		- * SCT is only used for migrations when the engine is changing.*
