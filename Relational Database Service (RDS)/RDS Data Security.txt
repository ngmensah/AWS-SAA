RDS Data Security

    - SSL/TLS (in transit) is available for RDS, can be mandatory
    - RDS supports EBS volume encryption - KMS
    - Handled by HOST/EBS
    - AWS or Customer Managed CMK generates data keys
    - Data keys used for encryption operations
    - Storage, Logs, Snapshots & replicas are encrypted
    - encryption can't be removed
    
    - RDS MSSQL and RDS Oracle support Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
    - Encryption handled within the DB engine
    - RDS Oracle supports integration with CloudHSM
    - Much stronger key controls (even from AWS)
    
  At rest Encryption (KMS Encryption & TDE):
    - With RDS Oracle - keys can be provided via CloudHSM - removing AWS from the chain of trust
    - TDE is native DB engine encryption. Data is encrypted before leaving the instance
    - KMS provides AWS or Customer Managed CMKs which are used to generate Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) for RDS
    - DEKs loaded onto hosts as required
    - Data is encrypted and decrypted by the host
    - Snapshots of encrypted RDS instances are also encrypted using the same key
    
  IAM Authentication
    - RDS Local DB account configured to use AWS Authentication token
    - Policy attached to Users or Roles maps that IAM identity onto the local RDS user
    - generate-db-auth-token - creates a token with 15 min validity which can be used in place of a DB user password
    - Authorization is controlled by the DB Engine. Permissions are assigned to the local DB user. IAM is NOT used to authorize, only for authentication
