Why you might run Databases on EC2:

    - Access to the DB Instance OS
    - Advanced DB Option tuning ... (DBROOT)
    - Vendor demands
    - DB or DB version AWS don't provide
    - Specific OS/DB combination AWS don't provide
    - Architecture AWS don't provide (replication/resilience)
    - Decision makers who 'just want it'
    
Why you shouldn't run Database on EC2:

    - Admin overhead - managing EC2 and DBHost
    - Backup / DR Management
    - EC2 is running on a single AZ
    - Features - some of AWS DB products are amazing
    - EC2 is ON or OFF - no serverless, no easy scaling
    - Replication - skills, setup time, monitoring & effectiveness
    - Performance - AWS invested time into optimization & features
