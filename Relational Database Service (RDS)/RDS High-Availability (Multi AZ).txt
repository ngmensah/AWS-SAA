RDS High-Availability (Multi AZ)

    - No free tier - extra costs for standby replica
    - Synchronous replication = Multi AZ
    - Standby replica cannot be accessed directly
    - All RDS access is via the single database instance CNAME, endpoint address. 
    - Standby database cannot be accessed unless a failover in the primary database happens
    - Failover takes 60 - 120 secs
    - Multi AZ is in the same region only
    - Backups taken from the standby database (removes performance impact)
    - Failover can happen in the following situations:
        - AZ outage
        - Primary failure
        - Manual failover
        - Instance type change
        - software patching
