EC2 Bootstrapping
  Bootstrapping allows Ec2 build automation
  User Data - Accessed via the meta data IP
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
  Anything in user-data is excecuted by the instance OS
  User data is executed only ONCE on LAUNCH
  EC2 doesn't understand user data but the OS DOES understand.
  
User Data Key Points
  User data is opaque (Not seen or not transparent) to EC2. It's just a block of data.
  User data is not SECURE. Don't use it for passwords or long term credentials. 
  Anyone who has access to the instance OS will have access to the user data.
  User data is limited to 16 KB in size
  User data can be modified when instance is in "stopped" state.
  The contents of user data is only launched ONCE at launch
  
Boot-Time-To-Service-Time
  AMI (Launch time to service time) = minutes
  Post launch time = the time after launch to make manual or automatic configurations before instance is ready for service. 
  How to shorten the post launch time? = bootstrapping.
  Bootstrapping = automates installation after instance is launched.
  AMI Bake = removes post launch time. No flexibility
  AMI Baking and Bootstrapping can be used together
