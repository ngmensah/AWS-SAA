CFN-INIT
  Allows you to set a state for packages, users, groups, sources, files, commands and services within resources inside a template.
  Helper Script - installed on EC2 OS
  Simple configuration management system
  Procedural = (User Data) vs Desired State = (cfn-init)
  Procedural = running a script line by line
  Desired state = direct EC2 how you want it to be
  Provided with directives via Metadata and AWS::CloudFormation::Init on a CFN resource
  
CreationPolicy
  Something added to a logical resource inside a cloudFormation template.
  CloudFormation stack waits for a signal from cfn-signal to determine if the resource bis complete or has an error.
  Creation Policies create a 'WAIT STATE' on resources...not allowing the resource to move to CREATE_COMPLETE until signalled using the cfn-signal tool
