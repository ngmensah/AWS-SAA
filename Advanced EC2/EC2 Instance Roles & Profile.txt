EC2 Instance Roles 
  Instance can assume and has permissions that the role grants
  IAM role has permissions policy attached to it. Temporary credentials are given to EC2 instance
  Instance Profile is a wrapper around an IAM role
  Instance profile allows the permissions to get inside the instance
  When instance is created, instance profile is created with the same name
  When instance is created using Command line or cloud formation, the instance and instance profile is created separately
  Instance profile is attached to an EC2 instance
  Inside a EC2 instance, credentials are delivered via the instance metadata
  credentials inside the metadata are always valid and rotated
  Inside the metadata is an IAM tree - iam/security-credentials/role-name
  Roles should always be used rather than adding access keys into instance
  CLI tools will use role credentials automatically
