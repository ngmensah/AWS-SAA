Enhanced Networkong
  Uses SingleRoot-IOVirtualization (SR-IOV) - makes it so that a physical network interface inside as EC2 host is aware of virtualization
  The host has network cards that offers logical cards
  No charge - available on most EC2 types
  Higher I/O & Lower Host CPU usage
  More bandwidth
  Higher packets-per-second (PPS)
  consistent lower latency
  
EBS Optimized
  EBS = Block storage over the network
  Historically network was shared...data and EBS
  Most instances support and have enabled by default at no extra charge
  On some older instances, it is supported but enabling costs extra
  Means adding dedicated capacity for storage networking to an EC2 instance.
