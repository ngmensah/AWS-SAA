ASG Health Checks

    - 3 types of health checks for ASG:
        - EC2 (Default) - Stopping, Stopped, Terminated, Shutting Down or Impaired (not 2/2 status) = UNHEALTHY
        - ELB (Can be enabled) - HEALTHY = Running & passing ELB health check
            - can be more application aware (layer 7)
        - Custom - Instances marked healthy & unhealthy by external system
        - Health check grace period (Default 300s) - Delay before starting checks
            - allows system launch, bootstrapping and application start
