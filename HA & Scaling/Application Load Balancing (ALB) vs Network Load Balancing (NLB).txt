Load Balancer Consolidation

    - Classic Load Balancer (CLB) doesn't scale...every unique HTTPS name requires an individual CLB because SNI isn't supported
    - Version 2 load balancers support rules and target groups. Host based rules using SNI and an ALB allows consolidation
    
    
Application Loiad Balancer (ALB)

    - Layer 7 Load Balancer...listens on HTTP and or HTTPS
    - No other Layer 7 protocols (SMTP, SSH, Gaming etc)
    - Cannot listen on TCP/UDP/TLS
    - Layer 7 content type, cookies, custom headers, user location and app behavior
    - HTTP HTTPS (SSL/TLS) always terminated on the ALB - no unbroken SSL (security teams)
    - a new connection is made to the application
    - ALB's must have SSL certs if HTTPS is used
    - ALB's are slower than NLB's...more levels of the network stack to process
    - Health checks evaluate application health....layer 7
    
Application Loiad Balancer (ALB) - Rules

    - Rules direct connections which arrive at a listener
    - Rules are processed in priority order
    - Default rule = catchall
    - Rule conditions: host-header, http-header, http-request-method, path-apttern, query-string & source-ip
    - Actions: forward, redirect, fixed-response, authenticate-oidc & authenticate-cognito
    
    
Network Load Balancers (NLB)

    - NLB's function at layer 4. They can interpret TCP, TLS, UDP, TCP_UDP
    - No visibility or understanding of HTTP or HTTPS
    - No headers, no cookies, no session stickiness
    - Really fast (millions of rps, 25% of ALB latency)
    - They deal with SMTP, SSH, Game Servers, financial apps (not http/s)
    - Health checks just check ICMP/TCP handshake....they are not application aware
    - NLB's can have static IP's - useful for whitelisting
    - NLB's can forward TCP straight to instances
    - NLB's and TCP listeners is how you can do unbroken end to end encryption
    - NLB's are used with private link to provide services to other VPCs 
    
    
    ALB vs NLB
    
        - Unbroken encryption = NLB
        - Static IP for whitelisting = NLB
        - The fastest performance = NLB (millions rps)
        - Protocols not http or https = NLB
        - Privatelink = NLB
        - Otherwise = ALB
