Elastic Load Balancer Architecture

    - Cross-Zone Load Balancing - the ability to distribute or load balance across AZ's
    - ELB is a DNS A record pointing at 1+ Nodes per AZ
    - Nodes (in one subnet per AZ) can scale
    - Two types of load balancers
        - Internet-facing - means nodes have public IPv4 IP's
        - Internal Load Balancer - Private only IP's
    - EC2 doesn't need to be public to work with a internet-facing load balancer
    - Listener Congfigurations controls what the Load Balancer does
    - 8+ free IP's per subnewt, and /27 subnet to allow scaling
