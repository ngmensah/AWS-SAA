Gateway Load Balancer

    - GWLB helps you run and scale 3rd party appliances.
        - Examples of 3rd party appliances include: Firewalls, IDS, IPS
    - GWLB are used for inbound and outbound traffic (transparent inspection and protection)
    - GWLB has two major components:
        - GWLB Endpoints - traffic enters/leaves via these endpoints
        - GWLB itself - balances across multiple backend appliances
    - GWLB use a protocol called GENEVE.
        - GENEVE is a tunneling protocol where a tunnel is created between the GWLB and the backend instances.
        - Packets are encapsulated and sent through this tunnel to the appliances
    - Ingress (gateway) route table directs any traffic destined for the Application Load Balancer subnets at the Gateway Endpoint in the same AZ.
