Evolution of the Elastic Load Balancer

    - 3 types of load balancers (ELB) available within AWS
    - Split between version 1 (avoid/migrate) and version 2 (prefer)
    - Classic Load Balancer (CLB - version 1 - introduced in 2009
    - Not really layer 7, lacking features, 1 SSL per CLB
    - Application Load Balancer (ALB) - version 2 - HTTP/S/WebSocket
    - Network Load Balancers (NLB) - version 2 - TCP, TLS & UDP
    - Version load balancer = faster, cheaper, support target groups and rules
