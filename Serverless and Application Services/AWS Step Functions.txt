AWS Step Functions

    - Step Functions allow you to create state machines
    - State machines are a serverless workflow that have a start and an end with STATES inbetween.
        - Serverless workflow = START -> STATES -> END
    - States are things that occur
    - The maximum duration for state machines are 1 year
    - The 2 types of workflows within step functions
        - Standard Workflow - This is the default workflow. It has a 1 year execution limit
        - Express Workflow - Designed for high volume high processing workloads like IOT, streaming, mobile applications
            - Run for up to 5 mins
    - State amachines can be started using API Gateway, IOT Rules, EventBridge, Lambda
    - Amazon States Language (ASL) - JSON Template
    - IAM Roles are used for permissions
    
States

    - Succeed & Fail
    - Wait - Will wait for a specific date/time or for a duration of time

            - DynamoDB
            - ECS

            - Glue
