Kinesis Data Firehose

    - Fully managed service to load data for data lakes, data stored and analytics services
    - Automatic scaling. fully serverless. Resilient
    - Near real time delivery (~60 seconds) *REMEMBER FOR EXAM*
    -  Supports transformation of data on the fly (lambda)
    - Billing - volume throught firehose
    - Can deliver data to: *(REMEMBER FOR EXAM)*
        - HTTP endpoints
        - Splunk
        - Redshift
        - ElasticSearch
        - S3
    - Kinesis streams are realtime ~200ms
    - Producers can send records to data streams or send directly at firehose.
    - Firehose can also read from a data stream as a consumer
    - Firehose offers near realtime delivery.
        - delivery when buffer size in MB (1) fills or buffer interval in seconds (60) passes
    - Firehose can't be a real time solution...only near real time *REMEMBER FOR EXAM*
    - Delivery to Redshift uses S3 as an intermediate
   
Use Cases

    - provide persistence to data
    - providing permanent storage
    - store data into a different format
