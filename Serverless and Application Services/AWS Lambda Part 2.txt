Public Lambda

    - By default lambda functions are given public networking. They can access public AWS services and the public internet.
    - Public networking offers the best performance because no customer specific VPC networking is required.
    - Lambda functions have no access to VPC based services unless public IPs are provided & security controls allow external access.


Private Lambda

    - Lambda functions running in a VPC obey all VPC networking rules
    - Lambda functions within a VPC can't access services outside of the VPC unless it is configured to access public services.
        - NAT Gateway and Internet Gateway are required for VPC Lambdas to access internet resources
    - VPC endpoints can provide access to public AWS services
    - Lambda needs EC2 network permissions via the execution role
    
    
Lambda Security

    - Lambda execution roles are IAM roles attached to lambda functions which controls the PERMISSIONS the lambda function RECEIVES
    - Lambda resource policy controls WHAT services and accounts can INVOKE lambda functions
    
    
Lambda Logging

    - Lambda uses Cloudwatch, Cloudwatch logs & X-Ray
    - Logs from Lmabda executions go into CloudWatchLogs
    - Any metrics such as invocation success/failure, retries, latency are stored in CloudWatch
    - Lambda can be integrated with X-Ray for distributed tracing
    - Cloudwatch Logs require permissions via Execution Role
