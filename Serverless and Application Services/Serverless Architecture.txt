Serverless Architecture

    - Manage few if any servers = low overhead
    - Serverless isn't just one thing
    - Applications are a collection of small and specialized functions. 
    - Applications run in either stateless or ephemeral environments
    - Serverless is only event driven. When it is used, it consumes resources (?)
    - FaaS (Function as a Service) is used where possible for compute functionality
    - Managed services are used where possible
    
    - Serverless is pretty much using a collection of services (managed services where possible) as another way to do things.
        - This is done without using EC2 for compute services.
