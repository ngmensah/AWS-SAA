Amazon Cognito - User and Identity Pools

    - Provides Authentication, Authorization and User management for web/mobile apps
    
    - USER POOLS = Sign-in and get a JSON Web Token (JWT)
        - JWT used for authentication for applications
        - User Pools control sign-in and deliver a JWT
        - Provide User directory management and profiles, sign-up & sign-in (customizable web UI), MFA
        - User pool tokens cannot access most AWS services
        - JWT can be used to access self-managed server based resources
        - User pool token used as proof of authentication
        - User Pool tokens can grant access to APIs via Legacy Lambda Custom Authorizers and directly via API Gateway
        
    - IDENTITY POOLS = Allow you to offer access to Tempoary AWS Credentials which can access AWS resources
        - Unauthenticated Identities - Guest Users
        - Federated Identities - Swap external identity for tempoary AWS credentials
            - Example = Google, Facebook, Twitter, SAML 2.0 & User Pool for short term AWS credentials to access AWS resources
        - Cognito assumes an IAM role and defined in Identity Pool and returns tempoary AWS credentials
        
    - Web identity federation = swaping of any external ID provider token for AWS credentials
    
User Pool & Identity Pool

    - User pool --> JWT (to the application) --> Identity Pool (generates tempoary AWS Credentials) --> Application (with tempoary AWS credentials) --> Access AWS resources
