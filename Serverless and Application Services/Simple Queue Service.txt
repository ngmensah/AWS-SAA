Simple Queue Service

    - Public service
    - Fully Managed
    - Highly available queues
    
    - SQS comes in 2 types
        - Standard - Best efforts with the possibility of messages being received out of order.
            - Guarantee at least once delivery
        - FIFO (First In First Out) - guarantee order of the queue. If messages come into the queue as "1,2,3" they will be received as "1,2,3"
            - Guarantee exactly once delivery
            - 3000 messages per second with batching
            - 300 messages per second without batching
            - Don't scale as well. Performance focused.
            
    - Messages added to a queue can be up to 256KB in size.
        - Anything larger than 256KB can be linked to S3
    - Messages that are received are hidden (VisibilityTimeout = the amount of time a message is hidden)
        - If the message is not deleted, the message will re-appear in the queue (default action)
    - Dead letter queue - this is where problem messages can be moved to.
    - Auto-Scaling Groups (ASGs) can scale and Lambdas invoke based on queue length
    - Billed based on "requests"
    - 1 request = 1-10 messages up to 256KB total
    - Short Polling (immediate)
        - Uses 1 request
    - Long Polling (waitTimeSeconds) 
        - waits up to 20 seconds
        - 10 messages up to 64KB will count as 1 request
        - Encryption at rest using KMS & in transit (Server side encryption)
        - Queue Policy 
            - control of who has access to the queue.
            - can only allow access from external accounts
