Event-Driven Architecture

    - No constant running or waiting for things
    - Producers generate events when something happens. Examples of events include:
        - clicks
        - errors
        - criteria met
        - uploads
        - actions
    - Events are delivered to consumers
        - actions are taken and the system returns to waiting
    - Mature event driven architecture only consumes resources while handling events (serverless)
    
    
Microservice Architecture - a collection of microservices
    
    - Process
    - Upload
    - Store and Manage
