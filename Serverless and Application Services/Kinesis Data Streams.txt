Kinesis Data Streams

    - Kinesis is a scalable streaming service
    - Producers send data intoa kinesis stream
    - Streams can scale from low to near infinite data rates
    - It is a public service and highly available by design
    - Streams store a 24-hour moving window of data. Goes up to 7 days = more cost $$
    - Multiple consumers access data from that moving window
    - Shards are used within streams.
        - Shards have 1MB of ingestion capacity
        - Shards have 2MB of  Consumption capacity
    - data is stored on a stream via Kinesis Data record (1MB = max size)
    - Kinesis data Firehose - connects to a kinesis stream. It can move large amounts of data onto another AWS service like S3
    
    
SQS vs Kinesis

    - When the question mentions:
        - Ingestion of data = Kinesis
        - Worker Pools decoupling = SQS
        - asynchronous communication = SQS
    - SQS 1 production group, 1 comsumption group
    - SQS = no persistence of messages, no window
    - Kinesis = huge scale ingestion of data
        - designed for multiple consumers. Has rolling window.
    - Kinesis = Data ingestion, Analytics, Monitoring, App Clicks
