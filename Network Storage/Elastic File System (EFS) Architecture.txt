Elastic File System (EFS)

    - EFS is an implementation of Network File System (NFS) v4
    - EFS Filesystem can be mounted on EC2 instances in Linux
    - Devices can be mounted into folders in the hierarchy
    - Data on the file systems shared between lots of Ec2 instances.
    - EFS is a private service, via mount target inside a VPC.
        - Mount Targets run from subnets inside a VPC
        - Mount targets have an IP address
    - Mount targets need to be in every AZ that a VPC uses for high availability.
    - Can be accessed from on-prem - VPN or DX
    - EFS can be accessed outside of a VPC using these hybrid networking products.
    - EFS Filesystems use POSIX permissions
        - POSIX Permissions = a standard for interoperability which is used in Linux
    - EC2 instances use mount targets to connect to the EFS Filesystems
    - EFS is for Linux ONLY
    - Lifecycle Policies can be used to move data between classes
    
    
    - EFS offers 2 performance modes:
        - General Purpose
            - Ideal for latency sensitive use cases, web servers, content management systems. 
            - Can be used for home directories or general file serving
            - General purpose = default for 99.9% of uses
        - Max I/O
            - suits applications that are highly parallel.
            - applications or workload such as big data, media processing, scientific analysis can benefit using Max I/O
            
            
    - EFS offers different Throughput modes:
        - Bursting
            - Works like gp2 volumes inside EBS
            - scales with the size of the file systems
            - the more data you store in the file system, the better the performance
        - Provisioned
            - can specify throughput requirements separately from the amount of data stored.
            - More flexible
            
            
    - EFS offers 2 storage classes:
        - Standard
            - used to store frequently accessed files.
            - it is the default storage class
        - Infrequent Access (IA)
            - lower cost storage class
            - used for storing things that are accessed infrequently
